"The UK's national debt has reached its highest level since 1962, according to new official figures. The total stock of government debt was worth 99.5% of the value of the economy in June, exceeding the highs reached during the coronavirus pandemic for the first time.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures also showed that the amount the government borrowed was more than expected in June.Borrowing refers to the difference between public sector spending and income from taxes in a given period.The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, said the latest figures were a �clear reminder� of the �worst economic inheritance� since the Second World War.",Economics 
"GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country.In the UK, new GDP figures are published by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) every month. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important.Most economists,and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily.That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers.If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses.If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more.This means more money for the government.When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse.Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending. Or taxes may rise.",Economics 
"Competition between mortgage lenderA host of lenders have made reductions to the cost of new fixed-rate mortgages in recent days.Brokers expect further cuts to come, but mortgage rates remain much higher than homeowners became accustomed to for a decade.Lenders' funding costs have hinted at falling with the Bank forecast to cut benchmark interest rates for the first time in four years.The interest rate on a fixed mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it. Doing nothing would leave people on a variable rate, which can be very expensive.A recent report by the Bank of England said that about three million households were set to see their mortgage payments rise in the next two years, including 400,000 mortgage holders who were facing some �very large"" payment increases.Renters also remained under pressure from the cost of living and higher interest rates, it said.Leading lenders have also said that housing affordability is stretched owing to high mortgage rates.Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later.Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house.Putting money in a savings account can build up and also earn interest to help to pay down some of the mortgage ahead of fixing a new deal.If you have an interest-only mortgage it means you are only paying the interest on the amount borrowed, and you are not paying down the size of the debt.Moving to an interest-only mortgage can keep your monthly payments affordable, says Richard Dana, chief executive of digital mortgage broker Tembo.",Economics 
"But after four years of rising prices, her support has worn thin � and every time she shops at the supermarket, she is reminded how things have changed for the worse.Ms Ellis works full-time as a nurse�s assistant and has a second part-time job.Still, Ms Ellis has sometimes turned to risky payday loans (short-term borrowing with high interest rates) as she grapples with grocery prices that have surged 25% since Mr Biden entered office in January 2021.Prior to inflation,"" she says, ""I didn't have any debt, I didn't have any credit cards, never applied for like a payday loan or any of those things.

"Labour has dropped a plan to reintroduce a cap on how much people are allowed to save into their pensions before paying tax.Under the pensions lifetime allowance, pension pots over �1.07m faced an annual tax of �40,000 on average.The Lifetime Allowance (LTA) capped the amount people could hold in their pensions tax-free.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt abolished it in March last year in an attempt to discourage older workers, particularly NHS consultants, from retiring early.However, she had promised that a Labour government would make exceptions for NHS doctors and other public servants when the cap returned.According to the most recent government data from tax returns, there were 11,660 lifetime allowance charges between 2021 and 22, a figure that has consistently increased over the last decade.Labour's decision not to bring back the cap follows lobbying from senior NHS staff and unions.Last month, the Financial Times reported that thousands of investors with large pension pots had been left in limbo due to errors in the legislation removing the LTA.�The Conservatives have botched their policy of abolishing the lifetime allowance, with thousands of people approaching retirement being left in limbo because of errors in legislation,� a Labour spokesperson said.",Economics 
"After pushing borrowing costs sharply higher in recent years to try to quell soaring prices, countries around the world are shifting gear.The European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday announced its first interest rate cut in five years, dropping its main lending rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%.ust a few years ago, central banks around the world were hiking interest rates aggressively, hoping that higher borrowing costs would weigh on the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.The moves were unusually synchronised, responding to global supply chain issues and shocks to food and energy markets that had sent prices leaping around the world.In the eurozone, the UK and US � economies that had not experienced inflation issues for decades � officials have been in a holding pattern, keeping rates at decades-high levels.Still the Fed, which was at the fore of the move to higher rates, has moved cautiously, reflecting concerns that progress on the issue might have stalled and that stronger-than-expected growth and major government spending might make it trickier to resolve.Such moves would bring relief to businesses and households looking to borrow.If central bankers cut rates too quickly, they risk unleashing a wave of economic activity that sends prices bubbling up again.But he said the US is unlikely to see a return to the ultra-low borrowing costs that prevailed in the decade after the financial crisis, pointing in part to big budget deficits that are likely to keep upward pressure on rates.",Economics 
"The labor market remains reassuringly steady, even as job gains cooled modestly last month. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported July 5, a small dip from May�s tally of 215,000 jobs.The unemployment rate moved slightly higher, up 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%. That marked the first time since November 2021 that the jobless rate was above 4% and also the third consecutive month that the unemployment rate increased.While economists aren�t too concerned about the current unemployment rate, subsequent increases as we get closer to the election could raise some concern.Slowing wages could help set the stage for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates � if they also end up translating into slower inflation. Strong wage growth can put upward pressure on prices, but Fed officials have said they focus primarily on inflation gauges to know if price hikes are under control or not.Along with interest rates, inflation has also been a top financial concern for Americans throughout Biden�s term, as pandemic-era pressures on global supply chains and price gouging by retailers have pushed prices higher and higher since 2021.Inflation rates are nowhere near the pandemic-era peak reached in June 2022, when US inflation hit 9.1%, its highest annual rate in more than 40 years. As of last month, annual inflation was 3%, down from 3.3% in May, according to the Consumer Price Index.Despite the improvement, it may take time for these data points to have a palpable effect on consumer wallets, as life expenses remains overwhelmingly expensive for many who have been worn down by consistently high prices for the past three years.",Economics 
"Price rises in the US cooled in June, building hopes that the world's largest economy is moving on from the bout of high inflation that hit after the pandemic.Prices rose 3% over the 12 months to June, as lower petrol prices helped to deliver the slowest price inflation in a year, the Labor Department said.It marked the third month in a row that inflation has fallen, easing financial pressures on households and potentially clearing the way for the US central bank to cut interest rates as soon as September.The Federal Reserve's key lending rate has stood at more than 5.3%, a roughly two-decade high, since last year.Fed officials say high borrowing costs are weighing on the economy, helping to reduce the pressures pushing up prices.Analysts said the latest report could help to convince the bank that it has done enough to cure the problem.�The latest inflation numbers put us firmly on the path for a September Fed rate cut,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The progress is welcome news for the White House, which has struggled with widespread economic dissatisfaction as the jump in living costs and interest rates squeeze households.Over the past year, petrol prices and the cost of cars and appliances have fallen, but the cost of other staples has continued to rise.Last month, the increases in rents and prices for services such as veterinary treatment cooled, noted Greg McBride, analyst for Bankrate.com�Shelter and services costs have been the long-standing and persistent trouble spots in the inflation readings but maybe the tide is starting to turn,"" he said.",Economics

""We want to see more good inflation data and we also want to continue to see a strong labour market.""In June, the US unemployment rate crept above 4% for the first time in more than two years.Consumer spending, which is the main driver of the US economy, has also shown signs of weakening, as rising numbers of firms warn that households are cutting back.Food giant Pepsi-Co became the latest to do so on Thursday.In a quarterly update for investors, it reported that sales in its North America Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods units had fallen in the April-June period compared with last year.

"Global trade �is not having the best of times at the moment�.�Global trade is really part of the lifeblood for making countries resilient - and also for underpinning growth, so we are concerned about that.�In recent weeks and months these fragmentations have come to the fore with the EU imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.4% on imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). It followed after the US in May introduced 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs.oth Brussels and Washington accuse the Chinese government of unfairly subsidising its EV sector, allowing producers to export cars at unfairly low prices, and threatening jobs in the West.President Biden has also increased import taxes on a range of other Chinese products that he said formed ""the industries of the future"". These include EV batteries and the minerals they contain, the cells needed to make solar panels, and computer chips.Meanwhile, the US has been pouring billions of dollars of government money into green technology, through its Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to reduce a reliance on Chinese imports.EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells the BBC that Europe does not want to close the market for EVs. �We welcome imports, we welcome competition, but this competition must be fair,� he says.",Economics 
"Last year, the volume of global trade fell for just the third time in 30 years, according to the WTO. It says the 1.2% decline was linked to higher inflation and interest rates, and is forecasting a recovery this year.However those factors have their roots in events that are continuing to fundamentally reshape the global economy, the International Monetary Fund�s (IMF�s) first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath explained in a recent speech.�What we've seen in the last few years, I would say, especially when it comes to global trade relations, is nothing like we've seen since the end of the Cold War.""That�s affecting countries as far apart as Peru, Ghana and Vietnam as they increasingly find themselves having to choose between strengthening economic ties with the western powers, or a China-Russia axis.�We're also concerned about the emerging fragmentation that we see in the trade data,� says the WTO�s Dr Okonjo-Iweala. �We're seeing that trade between like-minded blocks is growing faster than trade across such blocks.�She warns that �it will be costly for the world� to continue down this path. WTO research has estimated that price at 5% of the global economy, whilst the IMF has suggested it could be nearer to 7% or $7.4tn (�5.8tn) of lost output in the long run.",Economics 
"he EU�s introduction of tariffs on Chinese-made EVs follows a surge in their exports to Europe over the last few years. Exports jumped from $1.6bn in value in 2020 to $11.5bn last year, according to one study, which said they now made up 37% of all EV imports into the EU.BYD, Geely and SAIC are some of the Chinese EV makers said to have benefitted from billions of dollars worth of government help.After many years of support Chinese EV companies no longer need that help, says Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. �They are today simply very competitive on their own terms. I think the introduction of tariffs is a symptom that something is out of balance.�When it comes to broader relationship, Mr Eskelund says it�s �mind boggling� that since 2017 the volume of goods that the EU has sold to China has fallen about a third, even though China�s economy has been growing steadily.Citing Chinese restrictions around market access for overseas firms, and tough security regulations, he adds: �I think it's fair to say that that Europe still remains a significantly more open market to Chinese companies, then the other way around. And that is obviously something that needs to change.�The chamber�s recent survey showed that members have the lowest confidence on record for investing in China.It comes as the EU is trying to lower its economic dependence on China. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last year described the need to �de-risk not de-couple� its relations with China.Whilst the EU and China are set to hold talks about the potential EV tariffs, Chinese state media has reported that retaliatory measures are being considered on EU goods including pork, cognac and luxury cars.However, there are other barriers for global trade to overcome, including in two of the most important arteries for moving goods around the world.",Economics

"The Republic of Ireland's economy grew strongly in 2023, official figures suggest.The headline measure, gross national income (GNI), expanded by 5% according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).Most countries use gross domestic product (GDP) as the key measure of economic performance but Irish GDP is badly distorted by the activities of multinational companies.GNI, which has been used since 2017, strips out the most distorting effects to give a more accurate picture of the real economy.It involves subtracting the retained profits of some firms which have Irish HQs and making adjustments for some foreign-owned assets which are located in Ireland.In contrast to the increase in GNI, there was a 5.5% fall in GDP due to reduced goods exports by multinational companies.The CSO�s assistant girector general, Chris Sibley, said: ""The more globalised sectors of the economy contracted for the first time since 2013. Overall, the multinational sector contraction was 16.2%.""By contrast the figures point to a recovering domestic economy with personal spending on goods and services rising by almost 5% in 2023.The Irish labour market has performed strongly over the last year with unemployment at record lows.Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said the CSO figures confirmed strong growth in the domestic economy.""Despite facing significant inflationary pressures, consumer spending nevertheless drove growth in the domestic economy,"" he added.""This performance reflects the strength of the labour market, which has been at full employment since mid-2022.""",Economics 
"The Bank of England has opened the door to cutting interest rates in August in what would be the first drop in borrowing costs for more than four years.On Thursday, the Bank voted to keep interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% in a close-run decision.Earlier this week, figures revealed that inflation � which measures the pace of price rises � had slowed to 2% in May, which is in line with the Bank of England�s target. However, prices of some items continued to rise faster than expected.But the minutes from the Bank�s rate-setting committee signalled a significant change in tone, indicating a majority could vote for a cut when they meet again on 1 August.�On that basis, the committee will keep under review for how long [the] bank rate should be maintained at its current level,"" the minutes said.While not a done deal, this language is a clear signal to the markets and the public that after the Bank completes its new forecasts for the economy, a rate cut is now the most likely outcome at its next meeting.The Bank of England's interest rate has a knock-on effect on mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK.While the Bank appears to be hinting at a cut in August, many homeowners now coming to the end of a fixed-rate deal are facing mortgage rates much higher than they have become used to.The current average rate for a two-year fixed deal is 5.96%, although this is lower than last year's peak of 6.86%.",Economics

"For a while, there's been talk of 'the death of stardom', with young actors not able to match the clout of Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Will Smith et al. But that might be changing.There has been no lack of conjecture about what, precisely, makes a Movie Star. Most people would easily name examples for you, but might struggle to define why or how those examples were special. Film scholar Richard Dyer calls the star both ""ordinary and extraordinary"" in his seminal 1979 text, Stars, while academic and writer Jeanine Basinger, in her 2007 book The Star Machine, writes of Hollywood's production line: ""Sometimes a manufactured product turned out perfectly. Sometimes it blew up in the shopping cart"". And as Lauren Bacall once put it: ""Stardom isn't a profession. It's an accident.""For the powers that be, it certainly seems that whenever you try to bottle it or reproduce stardom, it vanishes. Many square-jawed hunks who look the part � say, Sam Worthington in Avatar, for instance � have been tried out by major Hollywood studios and fallen totally flat with audiences. Meanwhile others � like skinny teenager Timoth�e Chalamet in gay romance Call Me By Your Name � have climbed a strange and stellar path to the A-list. He is starring in mega-sci-fi franchise Dune, whereas in another decade he'd be doomed to playing foppish kid brothers in perpetuity. The fact that stardom has a kind of sketchy refusal to follow any exact science is maybe what makes it so endlessly fascinating to discuss.", Entertainment
"In a changing Hollywood post-Covid, with cinemas under threat and once-all-powerful streamers in disarray, it has been said frequently that there are no new movie stars. Perhaps movies had become too CGI-driven, too high-concept, too much about explosions and superheroes to really care about the human element, or faces in close-up that had been central to drawing crowds in the past. As Charles Bramesco, a film critic for The Guardian with a special interest in film stardom, says: ""The dearth of movie stars is downstream from a grander and more elaborate problem, which is the studio system's turn away from the mid-budget vehicles that turned likeable talents into household names"". In recent years, there have been many less adult dramas, as well as comedies, especially of the romantic variety, which as Bramesco points out, ""were once the bread and butter of Big Hollywood � but the (false) industry wisdom that they can't be banked on as reliably as special-effects bonanzas has resulted in big-time brain drain"".That might account for why one of our biggest current contenders for the role of Movie Star � Glen Powell � first got mainstream audience members' attention with the box-office success of a romantic comedy. Last year's rom-com Anyone But You, opposite fellow burgeoning star Sydney Sweeney, is the kind of late 90s/early 00�s throwback wherein two very attractive people hate each other but through a series of zany plot machinations are forced to admit they actually love each other. Powell, handsome in the old-school sense, with wavy blond hair and a sharp jawline, is a Texan to top it all off (even his name makes him sound like he should be in 1940s pictures with the likes of Tyrone Power). Powell first played supporting roles in films like Top Gun: Maverick as the jock you loved to hate but also kind of loved. (Tim Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, recently told Variety that ""Glen is the classic example of talent meeting opportunity."") Anyone But You went on to gross $220 million in cinemas internationally, starting off slow but becoming a sleeper hit, through word-of-mouth and a long theatrical window.", Entertainment

Anyone But You went on to gross $220 million in cinemas internationally, starting off slow but becoming a sleeper hit, through word-of-mouth and a long theatrical window.And so, slowly, unexpectedly, along has come a new crop of screen talent that is finally leaving an impression again. Margot Robbie, who had first registered as little more than an impressively sexy blip on the Hollywood radar after her turn in Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, has seized control of her career, become a creative producer, and taken on a series of roles cementing her as a Movie Star. Now, she's Barbie. And then there's been the rise of throwback cornfed all-American boys like Austin Butler, who shot to fame for his heavily Method performance in Baz Luhrmann�s biopic Elvis. The Hollywood Reporter, who recently published a ""new A-list"" piece with Butler at the top, shares that the industry talk is about Butler as a leading man for all seasons. Another big cultural presence is Zendaya, whose earnings for co-producing and starring in sexy sports flick Challengers totalled $10 million alone, with its success proving that she could transcend it-girl status for a proper screen role in an original, non-franchise studio film. If THR are to be believed, there really is a brand new wave of bona-fide Movie Stars primed for our screens.", Entertainment
"None of these figures were overnight sensations, and in fact, few real movie stars are. There's often one major film that is identified in retrospect as their star-making turn, but there are years of forgotten television roles and smaller parts that build up the constellation before a Movie Star emerges. Butler was a child star on Nickelodeon for much of his adolescence; Robbie, like many of her Australian cohort, first appeared on popular daytime soap Neighbours; Powell appeared in small parts in films like Hidden Figures, and many others emerged from television to serious acting careers, with HBO's teen drama Euphoria boasting a pretty remarkable trio of alumni: Zendaya, Jacob Elordi and Sydney Sweeney.The parasocial dimension of fandom has never been stronger, and media (social and otherwise) lies at the heart of the belief that stars are our friends.The parasocial dimension of fandom has never been stronger, and media (social and otherwise) lies at the heart of the belief that stars are our friends ", Entertainment
"They hate me for that,"" the singer says. ""I'm so sorry.""After Little Mix announced they would go on a break after their 2022 tour, Jade is the last member of the girl group to release her solo music and has long been appeasing fans with the promise it was on its way.ow her debut single, Angel of My Dreams, has arrived, Jade tells BBC Newsbeat: ""I'm ready to give some pop girlie drama"".But in a clip from the series, you can see the moment her face crumbles as judge Kelly Rowland tells her: ""I would actually love to see you in a girl group"".""I think the reason why I reacted like that was because in my mind when I pictured a girl group of the time, the bands that were popping off were like The Pussycat Dolls,"" Jade says.""Who I loved, but they were really sexy and little old me stood there in my braces and bow tie, I was like, 'How am I meant to be that in a girl band?'The music industry is brutal, especially if you're young, and you're going into it on your own.

"If Robbie, who seems to have a combination of ironclad business sense, down-to-earth charm, and preternatural sweetness � all while looking like Barbie herself � surprises viewers who, in accordance with sexist stereotypes, might expect her to seem aloof or vapid, all the better for it. It adds layers to her star persona, and it's what keeps people returning to her and her films. Meanwhile, Timoth�e Chalamet cultivates a deeply caring image when it comes to his fans, devoting much of his time to taking photos with and greeting them at events; the likeability factor is an important one. ""There's no substitute for charisma, and while many in the new generation of up-and-comers play on our nostalgia for a glamorous past, Powell's social-media savvy and puppydog relatability have placed him ahead of the pack,"" Bramesco notes. By contrast, though, a figure like Austin Butler has managed to cultivate a mystique, rarely posting to social media, and offering a slightly taciturn smoulder in all his interviews. Whether it's old-school Hollywood mystery or Glen Powell thirst-trapping on Instagram, both stars have made their personalities work for them. ", Entertainment
"A Movie Star, historically, conformed to a certain ""type"" � studios often had factory-line production strategies that required easy access to, say, a mysterious and dark-eyed stranger, or a matronly aunt with a comic streak, or an innocent blonde waif. Whether emerging from the stage, like the fearsomely beautiful screen-natural Vivien Leigh, or a village beauty contest, or a tenement slum like Barbara Stanwyck, there's a Cinderella-story element to the traditional movie star tale.  But stars are rarely just innocently ""discovered"", as the old story about 40s bombshell Lana Turner being stumbled upon while she drank a milkshake in Schwab�s Pharmacy used to go. You've only got to see one of the many iterations of A Star is Born (the 1954 version with Judy Garland may be your best bet) to see that the process takes labour, both from the person themselves and the team of star-makers around them: a star is groomed to perfection, taught how to walk, talk, dance, sing and comport themselves. And while contemporary star-making may not be like studio-era talent schools, which would sometimes train up-and-comers over a number of years, there is certainly still a sense that time and media savvy are essential to building up a star in the eyes of the public. From Marilyn Monroe copycats of the era, like Diana Dors and Jayne Mansfield, to the modern urge to find Tom Cruise's heir, the traditional idea of stardom is essentially a formulaic one. Studio execs, talent scouts and casting agents have sought to repeat and mimic the unique and powerful presence of stardom � to varying degrees of success. It�s not just a matter of simple charisma. But equally, careful devising of one's career is not always a guarantee of success. ", Entertainment
"The best stars have a radiance and magnetism, but also a certain self-awareness. It's important to have the ability to both choose roles which will seem to audiences as a logical ""fit"" for their type, and which go enough ""against type"" � aka allow them to explore their flexibility as performers. Take Austin Butler, using his Marlboro Man voice and retro cred from Elvis to delve back into mid-century Americana � la Marlon Brando and James Dean with The Bikeriders. Sydney Sweeney, an all-American girl who is both reliant on her sex appeal and determined not to be pigeonholed by it, is in dialogue with her own image at all times. The fact that her two upcoming projects are so different is by design: there's Jane Fonda's part in an upcoming Barbarella remake; but equally, Sweeney is co-producing a project about the decidedly less glamorous Christy Martin, the first professional woman boxer. ", Entertainment
"But the discourse grows topsy-turvy when no one can agree on the parameters of what makes a movie star. And maybe that's the whole point: it's ineffable. You might judge it by acting talent and dexterity, but many of the legendary stars played within variations of a type. Humphrey Bogart is sipping a short drink and drawling laconically regardless of where you see him; modern would-be movie stars, like Austin Butler, have also carved out niches playing parts of a certain stripe. Or you could look at bankability and box office success, which would mean Timoth�e Chalamet would easily make the cut given the financial takings of Dune 2 and Wonka � but others might point out these are both big franchises based on popular IP in their own right, and scoff at the fact such a nontraditional-type leading man was really a Movie Star. Or you might judge it by something far less nameable, which is: Glen Powell's dimpled smile as he gazes unerringly at his leading lady of choice, causing a frisson of recognition and desire in the audience which can only ever come from a Movie Star. Powell, in spite of not having led any existing franchise, has done well enough at the box office so far that his earnings are reportedly set to skyrocket, along with Chalamet's; according to Variety, Chalamet earned more than $8 million (�6 million) for Wonka, and his salary is now set to move into double-digits for future studio projects. Whether films can open solely on their names, a la Julia Roberts or Cruise or Will Smith, may no longer be the exact metric for Movie Stardom, but it certainly helps. And then there's the relatively box-office unproven Paul Mescal, who is appearing in Ridley Scott's upcoming Gladiator 2, suggesting that many of our burgeoning Movie Stars are progressing toward bankable, mainstream success. So whether it's pure charisma, mainstream appeal, or the canny combination of both, it does seem we�re lucky enough to have entered an exciting period for new faces on screen. And the fact remains: it may be nearly impossible to ascertain what special X factor makes a movie star, but you sure know one when you see one. ", Entertainment
"The trailer release has inspired a huge response, despite suggesting the Paul Mescal-starring sequel will copy the original. It's an ""ain't broke don't fix it"" formula that could fly.""The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an empire. From director Ridley Scott�"" You could run the voiceover for a trailer for the original Gladiator over the new trailer for its upcoming sequel and it would still seem reasonably accurate.The plot of the 2000 film boils down to ""Roman unjustly brought low uses his prowess in the gladiatorial arena to effect revenge on those who wronged him"" and, so far as we can tell, it also applies to Gladiator II, due to be released in November.Yet despite the fact that the new film seems to be a retread of the first, its trailer was greeted with frenzied excitement when released on Tuesday. Countless fans took to social media to declare, as the movie meme has it, ""This is cinema"". This is undoubtedly partly to do with the Oscar-winning brilliance of the original. Russell Crowe, in the title role, was never better. The action scenes were relentless, thrilling and visceral. The dialogue was eminently quotable. Even people who may not particularly remember the movie as a whole know ""Are you not entertained?"", ""What we do in life echoes in eternity"" and ""At my signal, unleash hell"". Film buffs can and will recite at the drop of a hat the ""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North�"" speech. ", Entertainment
"But there is more to the anticipation for the sequel: there is nostalgia for a whole different style of filmmaking. As we move past cinema's superhero saturation, Gladiator II is a callback to an earlier style of blockbuster. The once huge ""sword and sandal"" genre arguably peaked the first time round with Spartacus in 1960 but there seems to be a real appetite for it again. A major 10-part series called Those About To Die, set in Ancient Rome and starring Anthony Hopkins and Iwan Rheon, is released on Peacock next week. And Denzel Washington, one of the stars of Gladiator II, is also set to star in an Antoine Fuqua-directed movie for Netflix about Hannibal, the Carthaginian who challenged Rome.The release of Gladiator in 2000 was a watershed moment in modern culture for interest in Ancient Rome. Dr David Butterfield, editor of the Classics website Antigone, tells the BBC: ""Whether or not Gladiator II does reprise the plot of the original Gladiator, the excitement about a sequel speaks volumes about how drawn modern audiences are to immersing themselves in such a fascinating and influential civilisation, whose striking similarities to, and stark differences from, our own era prove to be equally instructive. The release of Gladiator in 2000 was a watershed moment in modern culture for interest in Ancient Rome. Not only did it bring to life the city which forged the empire that shaped so much of western history, but it also reintroduced into the mainstream long-forgotten subjects such as the complex relationship between imperial power and the mass populace and the principles of Stoic philosophy.""", Entertainment
"A new book tells the history of the ancient world through women. Here author Daisy Dunn explores what they had to say about their own sexuality � flying in the face of misogynist male stereotypes.According to Semonides of Amorgos, a male poet working in Greece in the 7th Century BC, there are 10 main kinds of women. There are women who are like pigs, because they prefer eating to cleaning; women who resemble foxes, as they are peculiarly observant; donkey-women, who are sexually promiscuous; dog-women, marked for their disobedience. There are stormy sea-women, greedy Earth-women, thieving weasel-women, lazy horse-women, unattractive ape-women, and � the one good kind � hard-working bee-women.Historical accounts from the ancient world tend to reveal the cloistered nature of women's lives. In Greece, women were usually veiled in public, and in Rome, they had ""guardians"" (ordinarily their father or husband) to supervise their movements and handling of property. Was the concept of the lusty woman pure male fantasy? Or were women of the ancient world more interested in sex than is generally believed?", Entertainment
"This summer, counterprogramming has been transformed again. Hollywood romantic comedies such as A Family Affair and The Idea of You have been consigned to streaming services, and there are relatively few major blockbusters on the schedule � just one Marvel film, nothing from DC, no new instalment of Star Wars, Jurassic Park or Mission: Impossible. That has left the way clear for a different variety of low-budget alternatives. Rather than light and feelgood films, we're getting dark and feelbad films, each one scarier and grislier than the last. We've already had Kill (bone-snapping violence aboard an Indian train) and MaXXXine (bloody mayhem in 1980s Los Angeles), and before the summer is out, we can see Trap (serial killer at a pop concert), Blink Twice (women trapped on a private island), Speak No Evil (murderous couple preying on holiday-makers) � and, of course, Longlegs. In effect, these films are anti-blockbusters. They aren't bursting with explosions and CGI, and they don't have sweeping orchestral scores and expensive ad campaigns, but they do offer the type of popcorn-dropping excitement that is best experienced in a cinema surrounded by other people. If they're successful enough, horror movies could become the new summer blockbusters, while superhero movies become the counterprogramming alternatives.", Entertainment
"There has been no lack of conjecture about what, precisely, makes a Movie Star. Most people would easily name examples for you, but might struggle to define why or how those examples were special. Film scholar Richard Dyer calls the star both ""ordinary and extraordinary"" in his seminal 1979 text, Stars, while academic and writer Jeanine Basinger, in her 2007 book The Star Machine, writes of Hollywood's production line: ""Sometimes a manufactured product turned out perfectly. Sometimes it blew up in the shopping cart"". And as Lauren Bacall once put it: ""Stardom isn't a profession.For the powers that be, it certainly seems that whenever you try to bottle it or reproduce stardom, it vanishes. Many square-jawed hunks who look the part � say, Sam Worthington in Avatar, for instance � have been tried out by major Hollywood studios and fallen totally flat with audiences. Meanwhile others � like skinny teenager Timoth�e Chalamet in gay romance Call Me By Your Name � have climbed a strange and stellar path to the A-list. He is starring in mega-sci-fi franchise Dune, whereas in another decade he'd be doomed to playing foppish kid brothers in perpetuity. The fact that stardom has a kind of sketchy refusal to follow any exact science is maybe what makes it so endlessly fascinating to discuss.", Entertainment
"One particularly vocal fan is Sean McCann, a podcaster who has dedicated hundreds of hours to theorising about the film. The ending of Eyes Wide Shut famously depicts Bill and Alice walking their daughter Helena through a toy shop. In a witty yet fraught exchange, the married couple decide to finally move on from all their petty jealousies and mind games by working things out in the bedroom. Biographer Abrams believes it's one of the most hopeful endings of any Kubrick film.McCann, however, insists it in fact features Helena being kidnapped (he claims two bald men in the background usher her away) and that the ""Magic Circle"" boardgame seen in the toy shop (its cover image replicating the blood red circle floor at the orgy) is a reminder that the cult Bill barely escaped from has ears and eyes everywhere. In McCann's imagining, they're finally punishing Bill for revealing their existence to his wife given that, at the sinister orgy, a mysterious figure in a red cloak (played by Kubrick's long term assistant, Leon Vitali) warns Dr Bill of ""dire consequences"" for his family should he ever speak oute says another earlier sequence, where Bill sneaks into the masked ball with the password ""Fidelio"", is filled with Freemason symbolism (including the Eye of Providence, which can clearly be seen as part of an eerie Venetian mask) and allusions to royalty (Bill is advised to wear an ermine cloak, a material associated with kingly robes). These are hints from Kubrick, McCann says, of the types of elites who might attend one of these masked parties and the existence of secret societies. ""I do get a buzz out of it!"" McCann admits of his devotion to dissecting the film. ""It's because I like to understand the hidden meanings behind things. The process of discovery makes you feel more enlightened. I'd say I was watching this movie twice a week, at least, for around two to three years.""", Entertainment
"Rather than seeing it as a film rooted in exposing hidden realities, Abrams says Eyes Wide Shut is about ""unreality"", and should be considered as a ""dreamscape"". For some street scenes, Kubrick filmed Cruise walking on a treadmill, giving a floaty peculiarity to his movement, and the recurring use of red neon lights imbues the film with a trippy glow caught right between Christmas comfort and living nightmare. The central musical theme, meanwhile, is a chopped and screwed up series of backwards chants by Romanian priests. ""The film is set in December, yet you can't see anyone's breath in the air,"" explains Abrams. ""It all adds up to this air of unreality."" Meanwhile the movie opens with Alice literally looking through the looking glass � an ode to the surreal Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. Abrams agrees with Pollack, who once speculated of the film's psychedelic powers: ""I don't think there was much in Eyes Wide Shut that was realistic, or that was intended to be realisticIt's a great irony, then, that online theorists come away with such definitive ideas about what the hallucinatory Eyes Wide Shut means. However, this also wouldn't be the first time a Kubrick film has sparked so much rigorous debate over its true meaning. Some believe the dense The Shining is littered with references to the holocaust and genocide of Native Americans (theories explored in the excellent 2012 documentary Room 237), while the ending of Kubrick's magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey, has been interpreted as everything from man evolving into a new form (or the �bermensch as Nietzsche put it) to the confirmation of a God. ", Entertainment
"Abrams understands why Kubrick films can be perceived in so many ways. ""There's a whole industry of YouTubers and also academics working out the meaning of these films,"" he says. ""Whether or not Kubrick deliberately inserted hidden meanings in the films or not, I can tell you he had a massive book on code breaking and subliminal messaging. A lot like the conspiracy theorists, he enjoyed that pursuit [of figuring something out]. ""But the thing worth remembering is this: yes, Kubrick did this exhaustive research on symbols, but once the cameras started rolling, it was all about how things looked. He didn't care about continuity at all and was just splicing everything together. I've interviewed a lot of Kubrick's collaborators and they say the symbols were on the screen simply because they looked cool. Kubrick's mentality was very much: 'we'll let the French critics tell us what everything means.'""", Entertainment
"Although Eyes Wide Shut feels hyper-relevant, Abrams would like the critical lens to now shift and for people to notice more of the film's warmth and nostalgia, particularly around the love of Kubrick's life: his wife Christiane. Mrs Kubrick's warm paintings, from a pregnant woman to a chicken hopping through a blissful garden, are littered throughout Bill and Alice's apartment, while the latter character is even styled to look like Christiane with both Kidman's glasses and hair copying hers.Kubrick famously rejected Hollywood social circles, choosing to live a reclusive existence in a rural mansion in Hertfordshire, England. Just like Bill, some might say, he rejected the allure of an elite group and chose to be renewed by the sanctuary of marriage and family (another painting in the film's background was made by Kubrick's daughter of the family cat, Polly), making Eyes Wide Shut one of Kubrick's more intimate autobiographical works. ""This film is a tribute to Kubrick's whole life, but particularly the maturity being married to Christiane gave him. Her influence is in a lot of scenes,"" says Abrams. �Kubrick was famous for his meticulous research: he knew he had to live out 40 years of marriage before he directed this film's themes. Eyes Wide Shut was something Kubrick wanted to make since the 1950s.""",Entertainment
"Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Stanley Kubrick's final film was poorly received on its release in the summer of 1999. But 25 years on, it's been reappraised as a masterpiece and endlessly theorised over.""Those were not just ordinary people!"" warns upper-class financier Victor Ziegler (a slimy Sydney Pollack) to a shaky Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise). The latter, a doctor to the elite, is still processing a mansion's masked ball he snuck into the previous night, which descended into a possibly murderous orgy.eleased 25 years ago this week, director Stanley Kubrick's divisive swansong Eyes Wide Shut, with a story centring on � among other things � the twisted misdeeds of the rich, has arguably never felt more relevant. Resonating strongly with recent real-life examples of elite degeneracy � notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was the ""living embodiment of"" the shadowy Ziegler, according to new biography Kubrick: An Odyssey � it has subsequently sparked fervent online conspiracy theories about the Hollywood sins the auteur was allegedly trying to expose. From YouTube deep dives to Reddit speculation, there has been a lot of discussion about everything from its supposed prescience to its dense, symbol-filled visuals""All of Kubrick's movies tend to grow with time and Eyes Wide Shut is structured in a way to deliberately intrigue people and ignite discussions,"" film-maker Tony Zierra � who has directed an upcoming documentary, SK13: Kubrick�s Endgame, dissecting the film's hidden meanings � tells the BBC. ""You see the film's themes reflected in news events. Whether it's the exposure of corrupt politicians, or sex scandals [in] celebrity culture or the entertainment industry, Eyes Wide Shut gets mentioned. Kubrick made a film that lives and changes with the time. I believe that's why he was so proud of it and told all his friends it was his best creation.""

His fervent efforts to save his campaign in television interviews and campaign appearances only exacerbated the concerns about his showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta. Three weeks of severe erosion in his political position saw a daily drip of defections from Democratic lawmakers, while party grandees like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed from behind the scenes. The drying up of donor cash also seemed to make Biden�s campaign unsustainable. Even if he wanted to go on, it became clear that he couldn�t.",Politics 
"Harris picks up enough delegate support to win nomination on first full day of her campaign. After potential rivals, lawmakers, governors and influential labor and advocacy groups all lined up behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a wave of endorsements from state delegations Monday evening pushed her over the threshold needed to secure the Democratic nomination.She�s been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to CNN�s delegate estimate � a moment that arrived on the first full day of her campaign.And with no credible challenger emerging the day after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed his vice president, it was already clear that the biggest remaining question about the 2024 Democratic ticket is who Harris will choose as her running mate.In her first day as a candidate, Harris raised $81 million, the campaign announced Monday, saying it was the largest 24-hour raise by any candidate ever. The huge haul underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic 2024 ticket. According to the campaign, more than 880,000 �grassroots supporters� donated, with 60% making their first contributions of the 2024 cycle.Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it �the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.� The Democratic super PAC Future Forward secured $150 million in commitments from donors in the 24 hours after Biden announced his decision, a senior aide to the group said. The commitments came from donors who were either uncommitted, unsure or previously stalled, the aide added.The hour-by-hour endorsements of Harris from Democratic governors, senators, Cabinet officials and state delegations unfolded by design, with the hope of reaching a majority of delegates by Wednesday, two people familiar with the process tell CNN.

The vice president has now been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates she�ll need to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to CNN�s delegate estimate.Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison also pledged to the party being �committed to an open and fair nominating process� that �reflects the dedication to democracy our party stands for.�According to DNC officials and a document obtained by CNN, candidates will need to declare their interest in becoming the Democratic Party�s nominee for president by filing a formal declaration of candidacy, meeting party and legal qualifications to be president, and gathering at least 300 delegate signatures, with no more than 50 from a single state.",Politics

The book, with touching stories about Vance�s upbringing, his drug-addicted mother and his foul-mouthed, gun-toting grandmother, attempts to explain the disaffection of the white, working-class Americans who felt like American society was passing them by as they witnessed the decay of once-thriving towns.Our men suffer from a peculiar crisis of masculinity in which some of the very traits that our society inculcates make it difficult to succeed in a changing world.At a time when immigration plays such an important role in national politics, it�s interesting that migration within the US is a key component of Vance�s book.

"Legal challenges to Democrats� move to nominate a new presidential candidate in the wake of President Joe Biden�s unprecedented decision to drop out of the 2024 race stand little likelihood of success, election law experts told CNN.Donald Trump allies have discussed the legal implications of removing Biden from the ballot, and whether or not they have grounds to challenge the issue, one source familiar with the discussions told CNN. It remains unclear whether or not the campaign or outside allies will ultimately bring such a challenge.�As a legal matter, it is up to the convention to nominate a candidate. And all the legal precedent is on courts deferring to the party�s choice for its nominee and then giving the voters the choice,� said Ben Ginsberg, a Republican campaign attorney who has served as general counsel for several previous GOP nominees.Before Biden�s departure from the race Sunday, prominent Republicans were raising the threat of lawsuits � perhaps in the hopes of further exacerbating the chaos that has plagued the Democratic Party since Biden�s poor performance at the CNN presidential debate last month.there could be political incentive for conservatives to sue. And as with Trump�s criminal legal troubles, courts have entertained novel and long-shot legal theories.The timing of Biden�s decision is a key factor in what happens next, legally. He made his announcement two weeks before Democrats were set to use a virtual roll call to nominate their candidate and four weeks before the convention itself is scheduled to begin.If Republicans wanted to sue over the swap-out of Biden for someone else, they�d likely wait until after someone else was formally nominated by the Democratic Party, Muller said.Another key issue is who would meet the legal threshold known as standing to sue and that will likely influence where any longshot lawsuits get filed.

The rallies have sparked one of the deadliest outbreaks of violence in the country for years and escalated into calls for Ms Hasina to quit.Ms Hasina has blamed the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami and their student wings for the violence, saying her government will work to ""suppress these militants and create a better environment"".Political analysts see the unrest as an unprecedented test for one of Asia's most powerful women.The over-politicisation of the spirit of the liberation war by Sheikh Hasina and her party, the denial of basic voting rights to citizens year after year, and the dictatorial nature of her regime have angered a large section of society,"" said Mubashar Hasan, a research fellow at the University of Oslo who studies authoritarianism in Asia.",Politics

And almost all of them are gone. It�s a reminder of how vulnerable we all are.�As one shadow cabinet minister put it: �Look at 1997 and look at 2005 - 2005 was a lot longer and went a lot better.�n 1997, the last time the Conservatives were ejected from government, John Major was replaced by William Hague within 49 days.

Lord Hague�s four years as leader were forlorn, Lord Cameron led the Conservatives back into government.One influential backbencher suggested that postponing the start of the contest would allow MPs to see how the putative candidates take to the task of opposition, for example responding in the King�s Speech debate or tabling urgent questions to cabinet ministers.�The problem is we lost votes everywhere at once,� one MP on the right of the party said. �Lots want us to just think about the challenge from Reform, and we must, but we can�t ignore our other former voters.�",Politics

Last week Reform UK claimed the seat, even though the Labour vote stayed roughly the same.If every Conservative loss were like that, the party�s clear incentive would be to focus relentlessly on those voters they lost to Reform.But then look at Stratford-on-Avon. At the 2019 election the Conservatives won this seat with 60.6% of the vote, way ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 24.3%.Last week, the Liberal Democrats won the seat, the first time anyone but a Conservative had won there since 1906.Yet the Conservative vote collapsed in more than one direction. Lots of votes were lost to the Liberal Democrats but Reform claimed 14.6% of the vote too.If those votes had gone to the Conservatives, the party would have just clung on to the seat.That�s before you even get on to all the seats where Conservative voters defected in large numbers to Labour.But it�s far from straightforward to assume that Reform votes would have just flowed to the Conservatives without Nigel Farage�s involvement.",Politics

Even if you can get some of them back you will lose others in doing so.�Even those MPs who think the Conservatives need to prioritise the Reform UK vote admit there is uncertainty about what�s behind the party's surge.The big question about Reform is whether it�s just about immigration,� one MP on the right of the party said, �or whether it�s also about economics and trust. Some of us think it�s something much bigger, a bit like a Marine Le Pen moment.If we�re right, then it�s no good just pitching for Reform votes by going harder and harder on immigration, because you can never satisfy enough of them, and with some of them you wouldn�t want to.

"The path for Vice-President Kamala Harris to secure the Democratic presidential nomination is clearing.That may end up being the easy part. The most formidable challenge � defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November � is still to come. Her elevation to the top of ticket would bring new strengths for the Democrats, but it also exposes weaknesses that were less of a concern with Mr Biden.According to recent polls, Ms Harris trails the former president slightly � a roughly similar position to the one Mr Biden found himself in before his historic announcement. But there may be more room for those numbers to shift as we move from a hypothetical matchup to a very real one.For at least a moment, Democrats have a jolt of energy after more than three weeks of intense hand-wringing over the president�s fitness and ability to sustain his campaign.All of Ms Harris�s leading potential rivals for the nomination have endorsed her, as has former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi � who remains one of the most influential players in Democratic politics.",Politics 
"This is, still, shaping up to be a tight race in November - a condition that reflects deep partisan trenches in American politics and the distaste many voters have for Trump as a candidate.The vice-president�s primary challenge � and opportunity - will be to capitalise on this Trump aversion, attract centrist voters in key swing states and energise the Democratic base, which was in the past few weeks swinging towards despair, to match the enthusiasm many on the right hold for the former president.This renewed sense of Democratic presidential enthusiasm comes with a dollar sign attached. According to the Harris campaign, the vice-president raised more than $80m (�62m) in new donations in the 24 hours since Mr Biden�s announcement � the biggest one-day total of any candidate this election cycle. Ms Harris, if she becomes the nominee, also defuses one of the most effective attacks the Republicans have levelled against their opponent: his age.For months, the Trump campaign has been pounding Mr Biden for being feeble and easily confused � characterisations that were reinforced for many Americans after the president�s halting debate performance four weeks ago.The vice-president, at age 59, will be a more energetic campaigner and able to make a more coherent case for her party. She could also turn the 78-year-old Trump�s age against him, as he would become the oldest person ever elected president.",Politics 
"Ms Harris may also be able to shore up support from black voters, who polls indicate had been drifting away from Mr Biden in recent months. If she can combine that with more backing from other minorities and younger voters � Barack Obama�s winning coalition from 2008 and 2012 � it could help her gain ground against Trump in the handful of swing states that will decide this year�s election.Her background as a prosecutor could also burnish tough-on-crime credentials. While her law-enforcement resume was a liability when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019 � and led to derisive �Kamala is a cop� attacks from the left � it could help her in a campaign against Trump.The vice-president has also been the administration�s point person on abortion, which has proven to be one of the most potent issues for motivating the Democratic base in recent elections. Mr Biden, by contrast, sometimes had been a reluctant advocate on the issue, hampered by a past record of supporting some limits on the procedure.�I think she reminds suburban women across the country, particularly in those battleground states, of what's at stake with reproductive rights,� former New York congressman Steve Israel, who headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told the BBC�s Americast podcast.",Politics 
"For all Harris�s potential strengths, there is a reason why some Democrats were initially reluctant to push Mr Biden to step aside, given that his running mate would be the clear successor.Despite generating Democratic enthusiasm on the subject of abortion, Ms Harris's record as vice-president has been mixed. Early in the administration, she was set the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border. A number of missteps and misstatements - including a ham-handed June 2021 interview with NBC News presenter Lester Holt � damaged her standing and opened her to conservative attacks.Republicans are already condemning her as the president�s �border czar�, attempting to make her the face of what public opinion polls have found is the Biden administration's unpopular immigration policies.Immigration is a soft spot for Democrats in those battleground areas,� Mr Israel said. �This is a very salient issue for voters living in those suburbs, fairly or unfairly. They believe that our immigration system is not managed strongly enough.�The Trump campaign will also try to turn the vice-president�s prosecutorial background against her � both by highlighting the former president�s record of enacting criminal justice reform and by attacking her past prosecutorial and parole decisions.Another Harris vulnerability is her chequered track record as a candidate. In her 2016 Senate bid, she faced only token opposition from Republicans in deeply Democratic California.Her one solo run for national office � a bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination � ended in ruins. While she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primary contests.",Politics
